      <h4 class="sec__sub-heading">World Army vs Aliens</h4>
      <p class="sec__paragrah">
        The world is going to be attacked by the aliens. The space intelligence
        department has raised an alarm and the world armies are coming together
        to fight them. The planning and strategizing is being done to make the
        maximum impact on the alien ships. The deadly missiles are to be put
        into action. The missiles are targeted to destroy the alien ships in
        space and disable them to land on the Earth.
      </p>
      <p class="sec__paragrah">
        The army is planning to launch the attack at A time (hh mm) to get an
        advantage. For each attack, they know the time the missile will require
        to hit the coming alien ship. They all are busy in preparation and want
        to know the time at which the blast will occur and the alien ship will
        be destroyed in pieces. Can you find the time of the blast ?
      </p>
      <p class="sec__paragrah">
        Note: The World Army follows a 24-hour time format and you need to find
        the time of blast accordingly. The time will be in the hh mm format.
      </p>
      <p class="sec__paragrah">
        <span class="sec__paragrah">Input Format </span><br />
        The first line of input consists of the launch time in hh mm format
        separated by space. The second line of input consists of the travel time
        for the missile in hh mm format separated by space.
      </p>
      <p class="sec__paragrah">

            Print the time at which the blast will occur and the spaceship will be
            destroyed.
